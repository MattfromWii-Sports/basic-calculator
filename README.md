A Calculator that can add, subtract, divide, or multiply. It does not follow the PEMDAS order of operations.

How It Works???
1. The User will input any combination of numbers that will be stored in an array (Preprocess).
2. When the User clicks an operator, the array's contents will be joined and pushed to another array (FinalProcess)
3. The program will then check if the lengths of the following arrays (FinalProcess, Operator).
4. If FinalProcess length is less than Operator length, the previous operator will be removed and changed to the operator clicked.
5. Else the current Operator will be pushed to its own array (Operators) will be stored.
6.
